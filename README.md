Please be aware that Mai Bloom OS is **highly experimental** and under active development. You may encounter bugs, unexpected behavior, or incomplete features.

* **Backing up any important data** on the USB drive you will be using, as it will be erased.
* Patience and a willingness to troubleshoot if issues arise.

## Installation Steps üõ†Ô∏è

Follow these steps carefully to install Mai Bloom OS:

1.  **Prepare your USB Drive:**
    * Download the Mai Bloom OS `.iso` file.
    * You will need a USB drive that you **do not need** for other purposes, as its contents will be erased.
    * Use a tool like [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/), [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/), or `dd` (for Linux/macOS users) to "burn" or write the `.iso` file to your USB drive. This makes the USB drive bootable.

2.  **Boot from USB:**
    * Reboot your computer.
    * As your computer starts, enter your system's BIOS or Boot Menu. (Common keys include `F2`, `F10`, `F12`, `DEL`, or `ESC`. This varies by manufacturer, so check your computer's documentation if unsure.)
    * Select your USB drive from the boot options.

3.  **Log into the Live Environment:**
    * You should be greeted by the KDE Plasma 6 login screen.
    * Enter `root` as the username.
    * Leave the password field blank.
    * Click "Login" or press Enter.

4.  **Launch the Installer:**
    * Once you reach the desktop, locate and click the "Install Mai Bloom OS" icon or button.

5.  **Initial Setup & Installer Download:**
    * The installer application will first guide you to check your internet connection.
    * It will then proceed to download the latest version of the installer components. Please ensure you have a stable internet connection.

6.  **Installation Process Begins:**
    * After you click the "Install" button within the GUI, three terminal windows will appear:
        * One displaying a Firefox web page (likely for information or help).
        * One running Arch Linux's `archinstall` script.
        * One for the Mai Bloom OS builder script.
    * **IMPORTANT: DO NOT CLOSE ANY OF THESE TERMINAL WINDOWS MANUALLY.** They are all critical to the installation process.

7.  **Install Arch Linux Base:**
    * Focus on the terminal window labeled "Arch Install" or similar (it will be running `archinstall`).
    * Follow the on-screen prompts within this terminal to install the Arch Linux base system. This forms the foundation of Mai Bloom OS.

8.  **Mai Bloom OS Build:**
    * Once the Arch Linux installation (Step 7) is complete, you can safely close its specific terminal window.
    * The Mai Bloom OS builder terminal window will then automatically resume and continue building the rest of the operating system.

9.  **Installation Complete & Reboot:**
    * When the Mai Bloom OS builder finishes, a dialog box will appear, informing you that the installation is complete.
    * At this point, you can safely restart your computer.
    * **Remember to remove the USB drive** as your computer restarts to ensure you boot into your new Mai Bloom OS installation.

10. **Done! Welcome to Mai Bloom OS! üéâ**
    We hope you enjoy exploring Mai Bloom OS.
